\title{Summary statistics from predictive distributions}
\description{
  Computes summaries based on simulations of predictive distribution
  returned by
  \code{\link{krige.bayes}} and \code{\link{krige.conv}}.

}
\usage{
statistics.predictive(simuls, mean.var = TRUE, quantile, threshold,
                      sim.means, sim.vars)
}
%- maybe also `usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{simuls}{object with simulations from the predictive distribution}
  \item{mean.var}{Logical. Indicates whether or not to compute mean and variances
    of the simulations at each location.  }
  \item{quantile}{defines quantile estimator. See
    documentation for \code{\link{output.control}} .  }
  \item{threshold}{defines probability estimator. See
    documentation for \code{\link{output.control}}.  }
  \item{sim.means}{Logical. Indicates whether or not to compute the mean
    of of the conditional simulations.  }
  \item{sim.vars}{Logical. Indicates whether or not to compute the variances
    of the conditional simulations.  }

\value{
  A list with one ore more of the following components.
  \item{mean }{mean at each prediction location.  }
  \item{variance}{variance at each prediction location.  }
  \item{quantiles}{quantiles, at each prediction location.}  
  \item{probabilities}{probabilities, at each prediction location, of been below
    the provided threshold.  }
  \item{sim.means }{vector with means of each conditional simulation.  }
  \item{sim.vars }{vector with variances of each conditional simulation.  }
