\title{Rainfall Data from Parana State, Brasil}
\usage{data(parana)}

\description{
  This data-set was used by Diggle and Ribeiro (2001) to illustrate the methods
  discussed in the paper. The data reported analysis was
  carried out using the package \pkg{geoR}. 
  
  The data refers to average rainfall over different years for the period May-June
  (dry-season). It was collected at 143 recording stations throughout \eqn{\mbox{Paran\'{a}}}{Parana} State,
  Brasil.
}

\format{
  The object \code{parana} of the class \code{geodata}, which is a list
  containing the following components:
  
  \describe{    
    \item{\code{coords}}{a matrix with the coordinates of the recording
      stations.  }
    \item{\code{data}}{a vector with the average recorded rainfall for the May-June period.  }
    \item{\code{borders}}{a matrix with the coordinates defining the borders of
      \eqn{\mbox{Paran\'{a}}}{Parana} state.  }
    \item{\code{loci.paper}}{a matrix with the coordinates of the four
      prediction locations discussed in the paper. }
